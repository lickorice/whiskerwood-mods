# Lickorice's (Carlos's) Whiskerwood mods!
A collection of [my mods](https://steamcommunity.com/id/lickorice/myworkshopfiles/?appid=2489330) for the game [Whiskerwood](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/).
## Want to start modding?
I only recently got into modding games myself, thanks to the fantastic community over at their Discord!
- Check out the original Whiskerwood modding template [here](https://github.com/Whiskerwood-Modding/Whiskerwood-Project)
- My first mod, Faithful Copper Slides, I've put on its own [Discord thread here](https://discord.com/channels/623169621872082947/1439264794526879855) containing the hurdles I've experienced

## Contents
Under `Content/Mods`, you'll find the raw stuff there for the following (in order of publication/initial implementation):
- **[Faithful Copper Slides](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3606407924) (`FaithfulCopperSlides`)**. An alternative textured replacement for the Whisker slides and conveyor belt slides.
- **[Whiskers' New Clothes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3606947805) (`WhiskersNewClothes`)**. Adds large poncho-style clothes for Whiskers when they get their Woven or Tailored clothing.

These mods above were packaged via **manual chunk ID assignment as-is**.

Feel free to load these into the Unreal Editor and tinker with them yourself!
